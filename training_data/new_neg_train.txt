Whether it's the 3rd round or 4th round Dustin Johnson just doesn't like Sunday's in majors!!

Looking at today's play at the #OpenChampionship You can't define Dustin Johnson's round as anything other than a choke. Tied for 2nd worst 
"Oddly, Dustin Johnson may be better served to play the final round chasing not being chased. He can play to win, not play NOT to lose."
